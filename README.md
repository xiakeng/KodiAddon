# Introduction
self usage only.

modify the skipintro to suite my needs
compared to origin version, changes:
- default to disable the addon
- remove update and disable button, only a clean skip button
- button can hide itself after into

# todo
- [ ] edl file support, so it can auto skip or promote skip according to edl file content, tvshow or movie
- [ ] integrate with jellyfin for kodi plugin. Initial plan is modify https://github.com/xiakeng/jellyfin-kodi so I can get actual file path from event
- [ ] use jellyfin api to get actual path info, so this addon can be more independent
- [ ] modify button layout so it can be used on my favorate kodi skins.
